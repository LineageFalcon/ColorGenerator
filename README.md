### What needs to be done

- [x] create function class for ColorConvertion
- [x] make bind obj for light and dark mode
- [x] exclude jquery to make it full vanilla
- [x] use createObj inside an instance class instead of strings and methods inside an obj
- [x] improve lightness changer function to work more accuratly
- [x] change the current view layout (UI) to a more responsive and base on UX one 
- [x] finalize refac with structuring classes based on MVVM/ MVP/ MVC (in this case MVVM)
- [x] change viewModel to work as much as possible with the logic instead with view (meant for less api calls because these cost a lot of ressources)
- [x] drag and drop of panel position (in progress...)
- [ ] adjust all variable names to a name scheme
- [ ] eliminate performance issues (never will be off the list =) )
